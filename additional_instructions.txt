- There should be a single single GameState object that is the source of truth and can be (a) cloned, (b) serialized, (c) hashed for caching
- reward shapping
    primary = final_point_diff
    bonus: +K for win (30 points) and -K points for loss
    Keep K configurable and log it
- perceptron is softmax logistic regression over actions for (discard pair) and (pegging card)
- train perceptron first by imitation learning from the reasonable player
- Benchmarking methodology.
    Require:
    - fixed random seeds per match batch
    - alternate dealer equally
    - swap starting positions
    - confidence intervals (or at least Wilson interval) for winrate
- Model registry/versioning.
    file convention trained_models/{model_name}/v{major}/best.json + history/ snapshots.
    Also store: git commit hash, training config, and evaluation metrics in the saved artifact
- Performance knobs.
    Add config for:
        - discard_rollouts, mcts_sims, belief_samples, max_depth
        - time-based decision cap (e.g., 200ms per move)
- Partial observability (belief sampling) spec.
    Require “known cards” definition: my hand, played cards, cut card (after reveal), discards (known/unknown), and how opponent remaining hand size is tracked. Also require determinism under a seed
